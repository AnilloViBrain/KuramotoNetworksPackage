Cluster analysis
===================================

Tools to perform clustering in a graph.

Formally from a Graph

.. math::
   G(V,E)
   
where *V* are the vertices or nodes, and *E* are the edges or connections weights. Performing a clustering of *G* is the same to obtain the partition

.. math::
   P_i=\{V_i\} 

.. math::
   \sum_{i=1}^{M} |P_i|=N
   
where *M* is the number of partitions, and *N* is the total number of nodes of the graph.
