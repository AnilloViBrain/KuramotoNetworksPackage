Welcome to KuramotoNetworksPackage's documentation!
===================================================

**KuramotoNetworksPackage** is a repository (that can be used as a python library) to simulate the Partially Forced and Delayed Kuramoto model. Also, it contains scripts with useful tools to do network analysis and functional analysis, with a computational neuroscience focus.

This repository is parte of the research Project Anillo ANID "Vibrain".

Visit us here: `Vibrain Web <http://vibebrain.cl>`_

The analysis tools are under development!

The inspiration of the model comes form `Steven Strogatz <https://www.stevenstrogatz.com/>`_ and `Joana Cabral <https://sites.google.com/site/cvjoanacabral/>`_ works.  

Dynamic Modes Decomposition uses the `pyDMD library <https://github.com/PyDMD>`_.
